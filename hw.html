 <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe Province,[21] the third of four children of Jorge Messi,
     a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side,
      he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy,
       and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family,
        "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat√≠as,
         and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.
         [22] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father,
          though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.
          [23] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, 
          he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.</p>
